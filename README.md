# simulationProject
Python simulation project using Simpy. 
This is a simple manufacturing quality inspection process simulation problem. 
1 sample from every batch produced has to go through a QC inspection, testing and a final QA inspection. 
We are to limit total testing time to within 30 minutes and using the least amount of manpower/equipment in the lab.
